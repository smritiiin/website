                In today's world, technology has a significant influence on studies, research, business, and
                almost every sector all around the globe. According to the statistics, 65.6 percent of the 
                entire world's population has internet access. There are 4.28 billion unique mobile internet 
                users worldwide, which makes up 54.6 percent of the global population. The use of technology 
                is catching on like wildfire. No industry has been spared from the effects of technological 
                advancements. We can't deny that technology is advancing so quickly that people are no longer 
                reading books or visiting libraries. Technology has given us the opportunity to study books 
                online or listen to audiobooks, which is a very comfortable and easy way to gain knowledge 
                and insight without investing in books or visiting libraries.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If we look decades back, the importance of reading books was remarkable. The sole sources of 
                knowledge and news were books, magazines, and newspapers. There wasn't anything called an 
                e-book or an audiobook. People used to visit stationary early in the morning to read the 
                newspapers and find out the latest happenings around the globe. But in the present day, people 
                first check Facebook posts and Instagram stories early in the morning before leaving the bed. 
                Even students who should be studying books for their finals are now relying on the notes in 
                different sites in Google Chrome and visiting YouTube for the concept rather than visiting 
                the teacher or resources in books. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                According to the argument, technology and social media have caused us to spend more time 
                reading short, frequent pieces rather than large, detailed novels. As a result, our attention 
                spans have shrunk dramatically. As a result, instead of reading every word and completely 
                absorbing the information in front of us, individuals today have a strong inclination to 
                scan through publications in search of a pertinent point. The disadvantage is that it can 
                lead to significant events being missed, intricate intricacies not being fully appreciated, 
                and only skimming the surface of long texts and books.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Even though there are various drawbacks, technology has become an inseparable part of our 
                lives. We now rely on technology for every small step in our daily schedule. We can visibly 
                say that technology has affected our ways of reading books and the time we spend searching 
                for books on the shelves of libraries or bookstores.
